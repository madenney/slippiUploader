Making a combo video is still a multi-step process.

1) Use slp-parser-js (https://github.com/project-slippi/slp-parser-js) to extract combos from slp files
2) Filter on the combos you want to include and generate a json file to use as an input for Dolphin that looks like the following: https://gist.github.com/JLaferri/a4f67390d7d5a39be89857c3375985c9
3) Make sure your JSON is valid using a validator if you are unsure. If your JSON is not valid you will not get past Waiting for game...
4) Boot Dolphin-Slippi latest version (the one used for desktop app playback) using the command Dolphin.exe -i "C:/path/to/comboinput.json" (or the similar version for your OS)
5) Start melee and record the output with OBS or similar.
6) Trim out all the parts in between clips.
